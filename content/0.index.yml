  headline: Hello world!
  description: a [Full-stack Developer]{.text-(--ui-primary)} and [Software Architect]{.text-(--ui-primary)} who crafts scalable, production-ready solutions in the modern JavaScript ecosystem — occasionally fueled by caffeine and stubborn optimism. Fluent in front-end sorcery with Vue.js and Nuxt.js, and back-end wizardry using Node.js, I regularly charm cloud services and headless CMS frameworks into submission. I believe great code should run smoothly — but if it doesn't, there's always coffee and console logs.
