  title: 404 - Boring Code Not Found
  description: I'm a full-stack developer and software architect who crafts scalable, production-ready solutions in the modern JavaScript ecosystem — occasionally fueled by caffeine and stubborn optimism. Fluent in front-end sorcery with Vue.js and Nuxt.js, and back-end wizardry using Node.js, I regularly charm cloud services and headless CMS frameworks into submission. I believe great code should run smoothly — but if it doesn't, there's always coffee and console logs.
